      <p class="text-center text-gray-700 mb-4">
      This is the home page of my tribute of my grandmother Wilhelmina, whoever called Mina.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Wilhelmina was born in 1941 in a small town in the gulf regional area of Louisiana.
      She lived through significant historical events, including World War II,
      and was known for her resilience and kindness. She had a passion for
      gardening and cooking, often sharing her delicious recipes with family
      and friends. Wilhelmina's legacy lives on through her children and
      grandchildren, who cherish the memories and values she instilled in
      them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center text-gray-700">
      She passed away in December of 2009, but her spirit continues to inspire
      those who knew her. This tribute page is dedicated to celebrating her
      life and the impact she had on her loved ones.
