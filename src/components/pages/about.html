        My grandmother was a kind soul. Who loved to all kinds of thing such as
        fishing,going in the boat and spending time with her grand and great
        grand kids. My grandmother was a very devoted Christian, who loved
        everyone and was always willing to help anyone in need. She was a great
        cook and loved to bake. She was also a very talented seamstress and made
        many of her own clothes. She was a strong and independent woman who
        raised her family with love and care. She was a great role model and
        taught me the importance of family, faith, and hard work. I will always
        cherish the memories I have of her and the lessons she taught me. sadly
        she passed away in 2009 but her memory lives on in the hearts of those
        who knew and loved her.
